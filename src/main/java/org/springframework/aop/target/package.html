This package contains implementations of the org.springframework.aop.TargetSource interface.
<br>
The simplest implementation is the SingletonTargetSource, used by default in the AOP framework
to wrap a single target instance. This is normally appropriate.

<br>
Other provided implementations include pooling implementations, that provide a target
from a pool for each request, ensuring a single threaded programming model; and a 
"prototype" implementation, that uses a new target instance for each invocation.
